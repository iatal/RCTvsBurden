# RCTvsBurden

We compared local efforts in health research to the local health needs. RandomizedCOntrolled Trials (RCTs) were considered as the unit of measure of the effort of health research and the burden of diseases as the measure for health needs. 

We grouped countries in seven epidemiological regions defined in the [Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2010 study](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd "GBD 2010"): High-income countries, Latin America and Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania, North Africa and Middle East, and Sub-Saharian Africa. We grouped the diseases used in the GBD 2010 study into 27 major groups as described in [Atal et al. 2016 BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1247-7).

Based on clinical trial registries available in the [WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform](http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/ "WHO ICTRP"), we mapped the RCTs started in 2006-2015 to each region and group of diseases ([Part A]("https://github.com/iatal/RCTvsBurden/tree/master/A-%20Mapping%20health%20research%20effort")). Based on the GBD 2010 study, we mapped the burden in 2005 ([Part B](https://github.com/iatal/RCTvsBurden/tree/master/B-%20Mapping%20health%20needs)). 

Within regions, we evaluated the alignment between local research and needs and identified groups of diseases for which there is too little research as compared to the local burden. Within groups of diseases, we evaluated the alignment between research and needs across non-high-income regions ([Part C](https://github.com/iatal/RCTvsBurden/tree/master/C-%20Comparison%20research%20effort%20and%20health%20needs)).

An [interactive visualization tool](https://github.com/iatal/RCTvsBurden/tree/master/Interactive_figure) is available to compare health research effort to health needs for different metrics of health research and different metrics of burden.
