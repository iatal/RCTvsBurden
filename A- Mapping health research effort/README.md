In this folder, programs to derive the mapping of RCTs and patients enrolled in RCTs within regions across 27 groups of diseases

To do the mapping, we have 2 initial databases:

1- All RCTs (as opposed to observational and non-randomized studies) registered in WHO ICTRP by Jan 2016 with start date between 2006 and 2015 with at least one country location included in the 187 countries included in the GBD 2010 study. For each RCT we have:
    - list of countries, regions, and number of countries per region
    - list of health conditions for 27 groups of diseases
    - sample size
    - year
    
2- Manual vs automatic classification of test set including 2,763 RCTs
